# UUID versions - infographics

- uuid.html - UUID versions from [RFC 4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html)
- uuid_new.html - new versions from [draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-04](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format)

The static pages were coded to create the images for the following post: [UUIDs Are Bad for Database Index Performance, enter UUID7!](https://www.toomanyafterthoughts.com/uuids-are-bad-for-database-index-performance-uuid7/)

# Development

Run HTTP server with `python3 -m http.server`

Live.js will then take care of auto-reload
